# MusiCLI

A no-fuss CLI music player.

`pip install pygame`   
`pip install mutagen`

- Run `python gui.py` for a bare bones GUI that mimics a media player with Play, Pause, Next, Previous and Stop.

- Alternately, run `python music.py <folderpath>` to play all your songs from the command line undisturbed.
